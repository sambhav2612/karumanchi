Hey Developer! Thanks for coming here, let me get you acknowledged with this repository really fast.

# Why?

I always wanted to complete this book since starting my graduation. Started as another side-project by end of May 2018,
I'm looking forward to July 2018 as the ecpected endgame. I was heavily motivated to complete this book since high school as well, so that served catalyst to fuel this reaction. I'm an aspiring **_polygot_** developer and working day-=and-night to get myself there in as little time as possible and supposedly this project might take me there.

## Workflow

Apart from the main book, the repository also has some extra implementations, also added as side-projects, mostly written in Python with an additional utility to constantly manage [and seperate] the CPP executables from their source files.

Keep looking out for issues made by us or in the codebase itself. If you find some please do make an issue and don't forget to file a PR. You can expect it to get reviewed by EOD unless a comment says otherwise. Merging would take place within 2 business days following PR creation. If you are new to GitHub, please checkout [these](http://try.github.io) resources before proceeding with contributions.

### How to contribute?

In my mind and checklist, I've many side-projects that can be [written in Python and] incorporated within this repository, some are:

- Getting out of a maze using DFS Algorithm
- Resolving deadlocks with Topological Sorting
- Constructing Bitonic Arrays
- Simulating Finite Automata
- Building Fibonacci Heaps
- Computationally proving equivalnce of Disjoint Sets (ADT)
- Solving the Classic Tournament Problem
- XOR'ing in search algorithms
- Building Suffix Trees
- Anagrams
- Huffman Coding
- Coin Change Problem
- Sort array with respect to the order of other sorted array
- Floyd Method to find shortest path length b/w each pair

To proceed, please create a new issue telling your requirements and we'll assign that issue to you ASAP, without any conflict on
first-come-first-served basis. We follow the **_Developer Certificate of Origin_** on Pull Requests. It requires all commit messages to contain the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address that matches the commit author. The **[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)]**(https://github.com/sambhav2612/karumanchi/blob/master/DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Contributors _sign-off_ that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```txt
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```sh
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

**_Happy Hacking!_**
